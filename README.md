This project was done as part of the "Computer Game Development" course at Ariel University.

You can see the assignment at the following link:

We made a game that is an imitation of the familiar game Icy Tower.
The player's goal is to reach as high as possible by jumping from a surface To the surface, and not to fall from too high a height.


The game has 4 stages, At each stage the type of stairs is different. <br />
In the first stage the stairs are tiled. <br />
In the second stage the stairs are ice samples. The friction with the ice steps is smaller so they slide more than any other step. <br />
In the third stage the stairs are smaller. <br />
In the fourth stage the stone steps and the camera move faster. <br />

In the side walls to get the effect of the Bounciness as in the original game we added to the side walls the physical material Bounciness.  <br />

<br /> 
We also added that when the player is disqualified he has a menu where the game informs the player that the game is over and he has the option to play again.
